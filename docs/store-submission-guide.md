# Chrome Web Store Submission Guide

Step-by-step instructions for publishing "Amazon Imperial to Metric" to the Chrome Web Store.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need:

1. **A Google account** (personal or business)
2. **$5 USD** one-time registration fee for the Chrome Web Store developer account
3. **The extension ZIP file** (generated by `npm run package`)
4. **Screenshots** of the extension in action (see below)
5. **The GitHub repo must be public** (for the privacy policy URL to work)

---

## Step 1: Register as a Chrome Web Store Developer

1. Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Accept the developer agreement
4. Pay the $5 USD one-time registration fee
5. Wait for account verification (usually instant, can take up to a few hours)

## Step 2: Prepare Screenshots

The Chrome Web Store requires at least one screenshot. Recommended: 3-5.

### Screenshot Requirements

- **Dimensions:** 1280x800 or 640x400 pixels (16:10 aspect ratio)
- **Format:** PNG or JPEG
- **Maximum file size:** 1MB per image
- **Maximum count:** 5 screenshots

### How to Take Screenshots

1. Install the extension locally:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the project root directory

2. Navigate to an Amazon product page with imperial measurements (furniture, TVs, or storage products tend to have dimensions)

3. Take screenshots showing:
   - **Screenshot 1:** A product listing with converted measurements visible (green metric text next to imperial)
   - **Screenshot 2:** The popup UI showing the on/off toggle
   - **Screenshot 3 (optional):** A product with dimension conversions (e.g., 10 x 5 x 2 inches)

4. Resize to exact dimensions:
   - macOS: Open in Preview > Tools > Adjust Size > Set to 1280x800
   - Chrome DevTools: `Cmd+Shift+P` > "Capture screenshot" (set viewport to 1280x800 first)

## Step 3: Prepare Promotional Tile (Optional but Recommended)

- **Dimensions:** 440x280 pixels
- **Format:** PNG or JPEG

Design suggestions:
- Use the 128px extension icon centered or left-aligned
- Text: "Amazon Imperial to Metric"
- Subtitle: "Instant unit conversions on Amazon"
- Background: Clean gradient or solid color matching the icon palette (#1a2744)

Tools: Figma (free), Canva (free), or any image editor.

## Step 4: Build the Extension Package

```bash
npm run package
```

This will:
1. Build the content script with esbuild
2. Run all tests
3. Create `dist/amazon-imperial-to-metric.zip` with exactly 9 files

Verify the package:
```bash
unzip -l dist/amazon-imperial-to-metric.zip
```

Expected contents:
```
manifest.json
content.js
background.js
popup.html
popup.css
popup.js
icons/icon16.png
icons/icon48.png
icons/icon128.png
```

## Step 5: Create the Store Listing

Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole and click "New Item".

### 5.1: Upload the Package

Click "Upload" and select `dist/amazon-imperial-to-metric.zip`.

## Step 6: Submit for Review

2. Click "Submit for review"
3. Review typically takes 1-3 business days
4. You will receive an email notification when complete

## Common Review Rejection Reasons

| Reason | How We Prevent It |
|---|---|
| Missing privacy policy | Hosted at `docs/privacy.md` in the public GitHub repo |
| Excessive permissions | Only `storage` + specific Amazon host permissions |
| Missing single purpose | Clear 102-character purpose description |
| Screenshots don't match functionality | Screenshots show actual conversion output |
| Remote code execution | All code bundled locally via esbuild |
